    "question": "Can I do cardio while binding?",
    "answer": "Yes, but with modifications. When binding during cardio:\n\n• **Keep intensity moderate** - stay at a conversational pace where you can speak in full sentences\n• **Take breaks every 30-45 minutes** to rest and allow deeper breathing\n• **Listen to your body** - if you feel short of breath, dizzy, or chest pain, stop immediately\n• **Consider a sports binder** - they're designed for physical activity and offer better breathability\n• **Stay hydrated** - binding can increase sweating and heat retention\n\nIf high-intensity cardio is important to you, consider doing those sessions without a binder when you feel comfortable doing so.",
