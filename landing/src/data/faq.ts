    question: "What is Trans Health & Fitness?",
    answer:
      "Trans Health & Fitness is a workout app built specifically for transgender and non-binary athletes. It creates training plans that factor in chest binding, HRT, surgery recovery, and gender affirming goals, so you can train in a way that feels safer and more aligned.",
  },
  {
    question: "Is this medical advice?",
    answer:
      "No. Trans Health & Fitness provides general fitness guidance, not medical advice. It does not diagnose, treat, or manage any medical condition. Always talk to your doctor or care team before starting or changing any exercise program, HRT plan, or surgery recovery protocol.",
  },
  {
    question: "Is Trans Health & Fitness actually based on research?",
    answer:
      "Yes. Our training logic is informed by a broad base of reliable, scholarly research and clinical guidelines related to: exercise science and strength training, cardiovascular and respiratory safety, gender-affirming hormone therapy and its impact on performance and recovery, post-operative recovery timelines for common gender-affirming surgeries, and injury risk, pain, and mental health considerations in LGBTQ+ populations. We translate those findings into practical programming rules, such as how hard to push on certain days, which movements are safer after surgery, and how to adjust for binding, fatigue, or lower energy. At the same time, Trans Health & Fitness is not a medical device and does not provide personalized medical advice. We encourage all athletes to work with their doctor or care team, especially when it comes to HRT and surgery recovery.",
  },
  {
    question: "How does the app handle chest binding safely?",
    answer:
      "When you tell us you are binding, Trans Health & Fitness adjusts your workouts. It reduces or swaps movements that can increase risk, for example heavy overhead lifts or deep chest compression, and it adds more rest and alternatives. Exercises that are more appropriate for binding days are labeled as binder friendly, with a short explanation.",
  },
  {
    question: "How does the app account for HRT and surgery recovery?",
    answer:
      "During onboarding, you can share whether you are on HRT and where you are in that journey, and if you are pre or post gender affirming surgery. The app uses this information to adjust volume, intensity, and exercise selection, for example more conservative progressions in early post-op stages, and realistic expectations around strength and energy changes on HRT. Any specific questions about your hormones or surgery timeline should still go to your doctor or surgeon.",
  },
  {
    question: "Who is this app for right now?",
    answer:
      'The Founding Athlete program is focused on trans and non-binary people who want structured, safer workouts that respect gender affirming care. You do not need to be a "serious athlete," you just need a body, a desire to move, and respect for the community.',
  },
  {
    question: "Do I have to share my legal name or medical details?",
    answer:
      "No. You can use your chosen name and pronouns everywhere in the app. We only ask for the minimum data needed to generate safe, relevant workouts. You can skip or update details at any time, and you can request account deletion if you want your data removed.",
  },
  {
    question: "What kind of data do you store about me?",
    answer:
      "We store typical account information, for example email, chosen name, and app usage data related to your workouts. If you choose to share HRT, binding, or surgery status, that information is stored so the app can personalize your training. We do not sell your personal data. Full details live in the Privacy Policy, written in plain language.",
  },
  {
    question: "How can I give feedback or report something that feels unsafe?",
    answer:
      'Inside the app, you will see quick feedback buttons after each workout, plus a "report an issue" or "something felt off" option on individual exercises. You can also use the contact form or email listed in the Help section. For anything that feels safety related, we encourage you to reach out so we can review and adjust.',
  },
  {
    question: "Can I use the app if I am not trans or non-binary?",
    answer:
      "Our focus is on trans and non-binary athletes, especially those dealing with binding, HRT, and surgery recovery. Respectful allies are welcome in later stages, however the Founding Athlete program prioritizes people the app is designed for.",
  },
  {
    question: "Will my workouts change as my transition changes?",
    answer:
      "Yes. You can update your binder use, HRT, and surgery status in settings, and your future workouts will reflect those changes. Over time, we plan to make this even more responsive, based on feedback from you and other athletes.",
  },
  {
    question: "How much does Trans Health & Fitness cost?",
    answer:
      "During the Founding Athlete program, pricing is $5 per month for members who are accepted, with that rate locked in as long as you stay subscribed. Future public pricing will be higher, as we add more features and content.",
